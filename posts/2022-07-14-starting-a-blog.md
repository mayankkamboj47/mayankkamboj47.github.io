This is not the first time I am writing a blog. I wrote one some years back, but I didn't stick to it. 
Hopefully this time. 

# Why again ? 
Some place online asked for links where they could find more about me. I could only share my github profile, because I have chosen to stay away from social media. Through this blog, I intend to share a bit of myself online, so that people can learn some things about me without talking directly with me.  

# What will I blog about ? 
Programming and such, certainly. I may blog about other things as well.
