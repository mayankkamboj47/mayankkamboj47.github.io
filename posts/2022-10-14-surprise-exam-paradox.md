title  : A Solution to the Paradox of the Surprise Exam
---
Disjunction of two non-surprising things can surprise. If someone knows I will have an apple, and I have it, he won't be surprised. If the same person knows I will have an orange, he will not be surprised when I have it. However, when the same person knows I will have an apple or I will have an orange, he will not know exactly which one until I pick one and take a bite - and therein lies the element of surprise. 

A popular logical paradox, called the paradox of the surprise exam, misses this point. The solution proposed in this post fills in the gap. 

The paradox goes as follows. You have to put a surprise exam in a book. You can't put it on the last page because when readers turn to the second last page, they'll know that the surprise exam can only be on the last page. The exam is thus not on the last page. If you put it on the second last page, when readers turn to the third last page, they'll know the exam is on the second last page, because it can't be on the last page. So they won't be surprised in this case either, and the exam can't be on the second last page. Now, you repeat and say that it can't be on the third last page, with similar reasoning. Once you reach the first page, you stop. This sort of backward induction leads one to conclude that a surprise exam can't be on any of the pages in the book. 

The problem lies at the point where we say the exam can't be on the second last page. On reexamination, once you flip to the third last page, you have two possibilities left. One, the exam is on the second last page and you are not surprised. Second, the exam is on the last page and you are not surprised. However, remember, that disjunction of two non-surprising things can surprise. If the writer decides that he will take the exam on the last page, you will indeed be surprised, because it violates logic and makes the exam unsurprising. How can you be both surprised and unsurprised at the same time ? We must distinguish the two different kinds of surprises. First, is the surprise where you
have the exam in front of you, and you couldn't foresee that. Second is the surprise where, from two or more unsurprising outcomes, you discover which one actually happens. In the former notion, the exam is never a surprise exam - the paradox is really no paradox, because preannounced surprise exams can always be non-surprising if one picks the right strategy (I'll elaborate on this). In the latter notion, the exam is always a surprise exam except when it is done on the last page.

I'll now talk about the strategy to make the surprise exams unsurprising. One could look at it as a forwards version of the backward induction the paradox does, or as simply "Study as if the exam is on the next day". 

The exam is on the first page, or the remainder of the pages. If it's on the remainder of the pages, you are not surprised. So it must be on the first page. 

Wait what ? Why are you not surprised if it is on the remainder of the pages ? Because then it is either on the second page or on the remainder of pages. If it is on the remainder of pages you are not surprised. So it must be on the second page. Again, not surprised. 

Why are you not surprised when it is on the remainder of the pages this time ? Because then it is either on the third page, or on the remainder pages. Either case, you are not surprised. 

You keep recursing as in the paragraphs above, until the set of remainder pages becomes just one, which is the last page. There it is indeed unsurprising that the exam be there.

I hope I have succeeded in demonstrating that such a "surprise exam" by definition can't exist, as there exists a strategy to not be surprised by it. The element of surprise lies only in when which side(s) of the disjunction is true. Say, for example, you are arguing "the exam is either on the first page or the remainder, and in either case I am not surprised". Yet, you are surprised by which case comes out to be true - whether it is on the first page or the remainder. To the person who is using the more traditional backwards version fo the paradox, being on the third-last page doesn't guarantee the exam is on the second-last page. It merely guarantees that there is a next guess the reader can make for where the exam is (second-last-page), which is either correct, or if incorrect, leaves future opportunity for making a correct guess (last-page). But it's not until you have flipped to the second last page, that you find out in which way you'll be unsurprised.
