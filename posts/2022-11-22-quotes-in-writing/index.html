<p>I have, very frequently, seen the use of quotes in writing. They can range from whole paragraphs, to phrases, to just single words, in the increasing order of snarkiness. I have often wondered whether it is officially part of the English grammar, since I've seen it used by my classmates and popular magazines like the New York Times, equally.</p>
<p>What use does it serve ? For example, is the usage of quotes in the sentence : &quot;He said his 'shoes' were loose&quot;, which suggests that shoes refers to something else, perhaps something metaphorical, the same as the usage of quotes in &quot;Your 'article' is published&quot;. In both these cases, there is similarity in that the word in quotes was first uttered by the other party, and is being reused verbatim (as if there is anything special about writing a word verbatim, which doesn't have a structure the same way a sentence does). Then, there is the suggestion that the word doesn't refer to what it literally means. However, that is not always the case. For example, in the sentence &quot;Your 'article' is published&quot;, the party who first used the word 'article' might indeed have meant just that. It is more apt to say that the other party didn't think it was an article. And thereby, the party puts the word in quotes.</p>
<p>If one disagrees with someone's usage of a word, they are of course, free to replace it with an alternate word. Instead, sometimes they choose to use the same word, while at the same time suggest that an alternate word would be more appropriate. Something akin to</p>
<ol>
<li>I don't agree with your word usage</li>
<li>I will not correct it</li>
<li>I will also choose to use the same word, just putting quotes around it, even though I don't
agree with your usage.</li>
<li>I will choose to communicate all of these points.</li>
</ol>
<p>The twisted nature of how the premises come close to contradicting each other probably explains why I feel that discomfort of twistedness in thinking whenever I see single quotes around some word in any piece of writing.</p>
